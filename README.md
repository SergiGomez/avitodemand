# Kaggle - Avito Demand Prediction Challenge

Link to the Kaggle challenge: https://www.kaggle.com/c/avito-demand-prediction/

When selling used goods online, a combination of tiny, nuanced details in a product description can make a big difference in drumming up interest. 

And, even with an optimized product listing, demand for a product may simply not exist–frustrating sellers who may have over-invested in marketing.

Avito, Russia’s largest classified advertisements website, is deeply familiar with this problem. Sellers on their platform sometimes feel frustrated with both too little demand (indicating something is wrong with the product or the product listing) or too much demand (indicating a hot item with a good description was underpriced).

In their fourth Kaggle competition, Avito is challenging you to predict demand for an online advertisement based on its full description (title, description, images, etc.), its context (geographically where it was posted, similar ads already posted) and historical demand for similar ads in similar contexts. With this information, Avito can inform sellers on how to best optimize their listing and provide some indication of how much interest they should realistically expect to receive.

# Important note: 

This Kaggle challenge was carried out with the sole purpose of exploring this Kaggle challenge, as the topic seemed to be very relevant for the nowadays business problems that we attempt to solve using data analytics. However, it needs to be highlighted that the code provided is not finished and there is large room for improvement. As said, the main goal was to have an end-to-end working model that could read the data and train a simple XGB model to predict over the test and prepare the submission file.
